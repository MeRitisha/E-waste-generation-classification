# E-waste-generation-classification
##Brief Improvisations Made:
1. Real Dataset Integration
Added GitHub URL data loading with automatic fallback to sample data
2. Smart Data Preprocessing
Automatic categorical/numerical feature detection and one-hot encoding
Flexible target column handling for different dataset structures
3. Realistic Sample Data
Created domain-specific e-waste categories (phones, laptops, TVs) with logical features
Target based on disposal methods (Reuse, Recycle, Hazardous, Standard)
4. Enhanced Model Evaluation
Added precision, recall, F1-score metrics beyond accuracy
Implemented class balancing for imbalanced datasets
5. Advanced Visualizations
Multi-panel EDA with feature importance and correlation analysis
Performance comparison charts and confusion matrices
6. Production Features
Robust error handling and flexible prediction system
Modular, scalable architecture that adapts to various dataset formats
Key Result: Transformed basic classification into a professional, adaptable e-waste classification system that works with real GitHub datasets.
